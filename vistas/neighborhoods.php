                    Poble Nou is a neighborhood in the Sant Martí district of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. 
                    Before 1714, the area on which the neighborhood would eventually be built was known as 
                    Poblenou del Mar, a large area of land between the city of Barcelona and the then-separate 
                    town of Gràcia. The area was essentially industrial, with many textile factories located 
                    along the Rec Comtal, as well as a large military fort (the citadel) overlooking the 
                    neighborhood. However, the area was far from heavily populated, there being only a few 
                    buildings here and there, such as the Torre de les Aigües ("Water Tower"), built in 1771 
                    and since demolished.
